# Description:

The methodology for generating inundation maps is based on the spatial application of an empirical relationship between run-up height (R) and the maximum inundation distance from the coast (D). The spatial analysis benefits from the use of GIS tools and functionalities, which allow the inundation area to be calculated on a Digital Terrain Model (DTM), using the input data listed above.
To simplify the GIS-based approach, a dedicated jupyter noptebook has been developed as a Python script using the QGIS module. Since it is open source, QGIS has been preferred over proprietary software such as ArcGIS (by Esri), Global Mapper (by Blue Marble Geographics), and others. The developed tool, named JN Tsunami Inundation, organizes the workflow and sequences the required GIS tools and functionalities to apply the empirical methodology. This allows users to obtain results by running a single, streamlined process.
